# Roundabout Builder (UUI Fix)

This is a fork of Roundabout Builder by Strad ([workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1625704117), source) with a fix for the missing UnifiedUI button in UUI Continued. Mod UI
window is also wider to accommodate the longer road names found in certain languages. Original README.txt follows below.

Thanks to boformer and Elektrix for I have reused parts of their code.

This mod builds a roundabout in place of any intersection. It clips the roads automatically back onto itself. Before using, clean the nearby area of buildings.
Recommended to use only on the ground on flat terrain. Save the game before using. Road anarchy is very recommended.

Usage:
Press CONTROL+O to open or close the tool menu. There you can select radius of your desired roundabout. It allows you to go as low as 5 units, but
you shouldn't go under 15 units. Alternatively you can use keys + or - to adjust the radius.
Click the Keep open button so it doesn't close when you unselect the tool. Click anywhere in the window to reactivate the tool.

Warning! If you want to break this mod, you very easily can. Do not use it on map edge, in water, under buildings...

Issues:
- When building the roundabout, this mod doesn't detect how close are the road nodes it clips onto. Sometimes they are too close and the roads are then buggy.
- Sometimes the direction of the roads is reversed.
- other...

Please leave any feedback! I am not an experienced programmer and probably I did many things in more complicated way then necessary.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
